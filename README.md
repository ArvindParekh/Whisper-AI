# Whisper: Voice-First AI Pair Programming

A next-generation developer tool that brings the power of voice-based AI pair programming to your local development environment. Whisper acts as an ambient AI co-pilot that you can have natural conversations with while coding.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Voice-First Interface**: Natural conversations with AI through voice, just like talking to a senior engineer
- **Real-Time Context**: Full awareness of your local codebase through live file syncing
- **Proactive Assistance**: AI can perform tasks like creating GitHub issues from TODO comments
- **Seamless Integration**: Simple setup with a single `npx` command
- **Modern Stack**: Built entirely on serverless architecture using Cloudflare's edge computing platform

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Local Client (The Eyes)**
   - Watches for file changes in your project
   - Syncs updates to the cloud in real-time
   - Minimal footprint Node.js script

2. **Web Frontend (The Voice)**
   - React-based web application
   - Handles voice recognition and synthesis
   - Real-time WebSocket communication

3. **Cloudflare Backend (The Brain)**
   - Session management with Durable Objects
   - AI processing with Workers
   - Real-time communication server
   - Workflow automation for tasks
